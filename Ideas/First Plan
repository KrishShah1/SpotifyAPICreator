Spotify Playlist Creator

Initial Idea
So you open a web page
There’s a form you fill out
It asks questions about

-Genre
-Era/Decades
-Artists you want to feature
-Number of Songs

We compile this data and then ask an AI
We can use chat gpt or any other open source one.

Then we compile a list of songs

Save this list and open the Spotify api
Then we create a playlist for the user for their specific needs

Just simple steps



Coding Steps

Step 1
Go over the whole project idea, build out the plan, and set up task

Step 2
We need to first understand the Spotify API - So how it works and making a new playlist for users (would they sign in or do we just let them add it to their account?)

Step 3
Find a way to get user information - we could do Python script but we can’t do that online - so we might wanna look into React as a JS framework

Step 4
Get the data and learn some firebase backend to store it
Back end is gonna be tough but luckily a ton of people are making BASS (Backend As A Service) so we can get a free tier and not worry about any of that

Step 5
Send the data to an AI - chatgpt has another API but it might charge (looks like a couple cents each 100 times) - and get a list of songs!

Step 6
Send this to the Spotify script we made - (Step 1 we should probably make a Python script) - and watch magic
